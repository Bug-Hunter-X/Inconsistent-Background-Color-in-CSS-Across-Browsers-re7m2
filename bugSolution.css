The solution involves addressing the CSS specificity. One approach is to use the `!important` flag (although generally discouraged for maintainability):

```css
.container {
  background-color: #f0f0f0 !important;
}

.container p {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}
```
A better solution is to refactor the CSS, perhaps by using a different selector that is more specific to the container and avoid directly specifying background color for the `p` element, allowing inheritance to work as expected or using a different approach altogether that achieves the desired layout without conflicting backgrounds. For example, if you want to change the text color, use this:

```css
.container {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.container p {
  color: #000000; /*Change text color instead of background*/
}
```
